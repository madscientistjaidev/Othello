# Othello
Othello (or Reversi) is a simple board game played by two players. The goal is to capture as much of the board as possible by placing pieces and capturing those of the opponent.

This project is a work in progress. It uses several algorithms to play the game, and allows one to measure their relative performance. Presently, strategies available are random, naive, and MiniMax.

This is an academic project, performed as part of the graduate-level AI course at Drexel university. Some of the boilerplate code was provided by the professor.
